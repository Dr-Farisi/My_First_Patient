# Cyberpunk Hacker's Terminal

## Overview

The Cyberpunk Hacker's Terminal is a simple, interactive web application that simulates a futuristic computer interface. It allows users to input commands and receive "encrypted" responses, creating an immersive cyberpunk experience.

## Features

- **Cyberpunk-themed UI**: Dark background with neon green text
- **Interactive command input**: Users can type commands into a terminal-like interface
- **Simulated decryption**: Displays a "decrypting" message before revealing responses
- **Glitch effect**: Applies a glitch animation to certain text elements

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How It Works

1. The application presents a terminal-like interface to the user.
2. Users can input predefined commands:
   - `decrypt`
   - `access`
   - `hack`
   - `run`
3. Each command triggers a unique "encrypted" message.
4. Invalid commands display an "Access denied" message.

## Code Structure

- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the page
- **CSS**: Styles the application with cyberpunk aesthetics
- **JavaScript**: 
  - Handles user input
  - Processes commands
  - Displays responses with simulated decryption

## Possible Enhancements

1. Add more commands and responses
2. Implement a more complex command parsing system
3. Create a storyline or text-based game within the terminal
4. Add sound effects for a more immersive experience

## How to Use
